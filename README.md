# PACE-L4DC2025
This repository contains the simulation codes for the case studies in my paper PACE: "PACE: A Framework for Learning and Control in Linear Incomplete-Information Differential Games" accepted to L4DC2025.
PACE focuses on intent estimation in real-time in linear quadratic differential games where all the agents are learning agents and are trying to learn the other agent's intent. The core idea in PACE is that for better intent estimation, better coordination, more system stability, and faster convergence, each agent needs to estimate the intent of their peers and account for their peer learning behavior and consider them as learning agents. For more information and theoretical guarantees, we refer you to the paper itself.

# Simulation Codes
the codes are available as a Jupiter notebook; I will later add more comments and explanations for each simulation and make them more organized. I will also add the information regarding the dependancies you might need to run the code, although you will not need complex packages.
